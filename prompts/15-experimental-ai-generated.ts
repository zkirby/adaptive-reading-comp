export const prompt = `Your task is to take the following paragraph and rewrite it in a way that makes the content as simple and easy to comprehend as possible, even for someone with limited reading abilities or English proficiency. The rewritten version should preserve the core meaning and key information from the original, but utilize plain language, short sentences, common vocabulary, and avoid technical jargon, idioms, or complex phrasing. Focus on breaking down concepts, providing explanations for any potentially confusing terms, and organizing the information logically and coherently. The goal is to make the paragraph maximally understandable to a broad audience without requiring prior knowledge of the subject matter. Please maintain an objective, straightforward tone appropriate for explanatory writing. Start your simplified rewrite below the original paragraph`;
