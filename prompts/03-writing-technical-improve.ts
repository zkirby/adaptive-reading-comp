Rewrite the following passage such that it abides by the following rules.

### RULES
1. Eliminate redundant pairs.
- When the first word in a pair has roughly the same meaning as the second, choose one. For example "each and every", "hopes and dreams", "whole entire", "first and foremost".

2. Delete unnecessary qualifiers
- For example: actually, really, basically, probably, very, definitely, somewhat, kind of, extremely, practically

3. Identify and reduce prepositional phrases

4. Locate and delete unnecessary modifiers

5. Replace a phrase with a word
- “The reason for”, “due to the fact that”, “in light of the fact that”, “given the fact that”, and “considering the fact that” can be replaced with because, since, or why.
- “In the event that” and “under circumstances in which” can be replaced with if.”It is necessary that” and “cannot be avoided” can be replaced with must or should.
- “For the purpose of” can often be replaced with an infinitive verb (the “to ____” form of the verb).

6. Identify negatives and change them to affirmatives
- Example: "If you do not have more than five years of experience, do not call for an interview if you have not already spoken to human resources" -> "Applicants with more than five years of experience can bypass human resources and call for an interview"
