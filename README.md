## About

An atomic approach to prompt building. This repo demonstrates an approach to building complex multi-effect prompts:

1. Exhaustively explore and create all possible effects/transformations (these are the 'atoms')
2. Run prompts on all source paragraphs and pairwise rank results.
3. [to implement] Merge and combine winning prompts - repeat step 1.

## Run

- `test.ts`: runs the prompts on the source paragraphs from the reference papers
- `rank.ts`: pairwise ranking of run results
- `translation.ts`: visualization of run and rank results
- `data.json`: source and translation paragraphs
